<p>Hello there!
Great to see you again. We already missed you and are glad to see, that you seem to be as curious as we are discovering the second part of our project.
Here you will learn more about the results and the idea behind our project.</p>

       <p>For this purpose you have commented, described and annotated sequences – <span class="markedRaw">thank you btw!</span> – in which the face of the dancer is clearly recognizable. In the second step, we showed you a longer version of the dance, which included various elements and dance steps as well as all ten previously shown sequences. However, the face was blurred so that one could only see her body. Were these sequences still interpreted in the same way as the short ones before? Have the sequences contributed to the interpretation despite censorship? The following metrics should make that clear.*</p>

</div>

<p>At first glance, it is noticeable that the majority connects rather negative feelings with all excerpts of the dance. „Negative" comments are in this case classified as "sad", "angry", "aggressive" or "helpless". It is also interesting that in the same scenes in which the face is censored, the interpretations about the meaning do not differ so much. By "positive" we mean comments like "happy", "strong" or "energetic". Annotations like "It's Britney Bitch." are assigned to the category "neither". In the same scenes without seeing the face, we were even able to filter five clips in which all movements have been categorized as negative or positive. Whereas the addition of facial expressions allows a wider scope of interpretation. 1/3 of the annotations could not be assigned clearly as positive or negative but were more diverse in their interpretation.
Yet, we can not formulate a conclusion on how facial expressions change the interpretation of the observer. However, it is clear that facial expressions definitely have an impact on our perception.</p>

<p>*The statistics refer to the time until the 24th of January 2018. Since the experiment is not time-limited, the diagrams and results may change. We stay tuned and keep you up to date. Promised!</p>
  
<p>And now we finally show you the <span class="markedRaw"><a href="fullvideo.html">whole dance!</a></span> Tributes to the dancer Lisa, her coach Svenja Schäfer and Mirco Jüngling who helped us a lot to realize our project. Lisa, you dancing skills are admirable!
